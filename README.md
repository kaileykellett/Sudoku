# Sudoku
A sudoku puzzle I developed in Grade 12 of my high school Computer Science class. While this project was a requirement for everyone in the class, 
there were a number of things I added unnecessarily that I'm proud of, such as "singles solvers" and hints/small numbers in each box with possible solutions that could be toggled on or off.

This project was not perfect and I'd like to come back to it (one of the glaring issues is it does not properly sense a loss). However, it was very enjoyable to make, and I loved using big 2D arrays for the grid aspect, as well as the work that went into sensing where the mouse is located on the screen and whether or not it was on a "valid" location.
